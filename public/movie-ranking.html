<h2>Top 3 movies that I watched in my life</h2>
<hr />

<h3>After (2019)</h3>
<p>A love story of two students at a college. I love the story, how they met, how they look at each other, and how they talk to each other. 
    <br />And of course, I love the soundtracks of the movie. They are sure masterpieces!
</p>

<h3>The Double (2011) (Richard Gere)</h3>
<p>Here we can see the artistic mastery of a famous actor Richard Gere (One of my favorite actors). He played the role with such focus and commitment that it made me watch it again and again.
    <br />I would highly recommend it. You won't regret spending your time watching it!

<h3>Shooter (2007) (Mark Wahlberg)</h3>
<p>Bob Lee Swagger - ex-military, sniper, lone wolf, dog owner, and a man with pride. He returns to life for revenge after being backstabbed by a general who convinced him to kill a president with his fake ideas.</p>
